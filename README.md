# AI-DLC for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that implements the **AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)** methodology -- a structured, adaptive software development workflow that guides AI assistants through disciplined three-phase development.

AI-DLC intelligently adapts to your project: simple changes execute only essential stages, while complex projects receive comprehensive treatment with full safeguards.

**[Documentation](https://mateon01.github.io/aidlc-for-claude)** | **[Apache-2.0 License](LICENSE)**

## Installation

In the Claude Code chat, run these two commands:

```
/plugin marketplace add mateon01/aidlc-for-claude
/plugin install aidlc-for-claude
```

## Quick Start

```
/aidlc
```

That's it. The orchestrator detects your workspace (greenfield or brownfield), gathers requirements through interactive Q&A, and walks through each phase with you. Every stage requires your approval before proceeding.

To run a specific stage independently:

```
/aidlc-requirements-analysis
/aidlc-code-generation
```

## How It Works

AI-DLC has three phases. Each phase contains stages that may execute conditionally based on your project's needs.

### Stage Execution

Not every stage runs every time. After Workflow Planning, an execution plan determines which stages are needed:

| Condition | Stages Executed |
|-----------|----------------|
| Simple bug fix | Workspace Detection, Requirements, Workflow Planning, Code Generation, Build and Test |
| Simple brownfield (fast path) | Workspace Detection, Reverse Engineering, Workflow Planning (minimal), Code Generation, Build and Test |
| New feature (greenfield) | All INCEPTION + all CONSTRUCTION stages |
| Brownfield modification | Adds Reverse Engineering, adapts scope based on existing codebase |
| Infrastructure-only change | Skips User Stories, Functional Design; includes Infrastructure Design |

You can override any recommendation at the Workflow Planning approval gate.

### Haiku (Fast Detection)

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `aidlc-for-claude:aidlc-workspace-analyst` | Workspace scanning and project type detection |

**Model strategy:** Opus handles stages requiring deep reasoning (requirements analysis, architectural decisions, planning). Sonnet handles volume work (design documents, code generation, testing, operations). Haiku handles fast detection (workspace scanning, project classification).

Total: **19 specialized agents** across 3 model tiers.

## Key Conventions

**Deep questioning** -- INCEPTION stages ask 15-30 practical questions across mandatory analysis categories (12 for requirements, 10 for application design, 12 for stories, 9 for units) with multi-round md file Q&A. Each category requires at least 1 question, and agents have mandatory minimums to prevent shallow analysis.

**Interactive Q&A** -- Simple preference questions use Claude Code's interactive question UI (AskUserQuestion) with clickable options. Complex questions with many items use document-based questionnaires. All decisions are documented in the audit trail.

**Brownfield fast path** -- For existing codebases, a scope assessment after workspace detection lets you choose between four options: simple change (fast path to code generation), complex change (streamlined path), new component within existing repo, or full structured workflow.

**Prerequisite validation** -- Construction agents verify required input files exist before proceeding, failing fast with clear errors if a prior stage was skipped.

**System-level NFR** -- For multi-unit projects, cross-cutting NFR decisions (authentication, observability, error handling) are established once before the per-unit loop, preventing contradictory choices.

**Approval gates** are required at each stage. You review the generated artifacts and choose to approve, request changes, or add/remove stages.

**Audit trail** (`aidlc-docs/audit.md`) captures every user input with ISO 8601 timestamps. It is append-only and never overwritten.

**Session continuity** is handled via `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`. Re-running `/aidlc` detects existing state and offers to resume.

**Error recovery** -- Failed stages can be retried, skipped, or aborted. State is preserved for session continuity. Build failures are retried up to 3 times with automated fix attempts.

**Stage banners (MOTD)** -- Every agent displays a formatted banner on start showing phase, stage number, agent name, model, and key capabilities. The orchestrator also shows a stage banner before each delegation, so you always know which stage is running and what to expect.

**Parallel unit execution** -- CONSTRUCTION supports concurrent unit processing for projects with 3 or more units. Units with no inter-dependencies execute simultaneously in parallel groups, reducing total build time. File ownership ensures no conflicts between parallel units. Shared files are modified only in the final Build & Test phase.

**Batch approval** -- Optionally auto-approve construction design stages (Functional Design through Infrastructure Design) to reduce review overhead on large projects. Code Generation and Build & Test still require explicit review.

**Git safety** -- Brownfield code generation creates a `aidlc/{unit-name}` git branch before modifying existing files, providing a safe rollback point.

**Code quality gate** -- Before presenting generated code, the agent runs a multi-layer quality check: type/syntax check (tsc, py_compile, cargo check, go vet), lint check (ESLint, Ruff, Clippy if configured), and unit test execution. Auto-fixes issues up to 3 times.

**Test-first code generation** -- Code generation plans include mandatory test plans per module with test file paths, test cases, and coverage targets. Test files are generated alongside application code as first-class artifacts.

**Dependency security scanning** -- Build and Test stage runs `npm audit` / `pip audit` / `cargo audit` to catch known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Results are informational (not gating).

**Test coverage tracking** -- Test execution includes coverage flags (--coverage, --cov) when available. Coverage percentage is reported in the execution report.

**Integration test scaffolding** -- For multi-unit projects, executable integration test files are generated to verify cross-unit interfaces, API contracts, and shared data models.

**E2E test scaffolding** -- For web applications, optional Playwright or Cypress test scaffolds with basic smoke tests are generated based on data-testid attributes in UI components.

**Operations artifacts** -- The Operations phase generates executable artifacts beyond documentation: CI/CD pipeline, Dockerfile, Docker Compose, .env.example, root README.md, and monitoring configuration.

**Design conformance check** -- Optional verification that generated code matches functional design artifacts (domain entities, API endpoints, business rules).

**Cross-unit consistency** -- When building multi-unit systems, each unit receives summaries of all previously completed units to maintain consistent domain models, tech stack choices, and conventions.

**PR review** -- The `/aidlc-review-pr` standalone utility analyzes PR diffs or local changes across 6 categories (correctness, security, performance, consistency, testing, documentation). It can review GitHub PRs, local changes, or branch diffs independently of the three-phase workflow.

**CI setup** -- The `/aidlc-ci-setup` standalone utility generates CI/CD infrastructure for any project. It detects the tech stack automatically and generates CI/CD pipelines, AI-powered PR review workflows, issue templates, and PR templates -- no prior AI-DLC stages required.

**Dependency graph** -- Optional graph-based code dependency analysis with multi-backend support. During Workflow Planning, choose from three backends: **Neo4j Local** (Docker-based with Cypher queries and browser visualization), **AWS Neptune** (managed graph DB with IaC provisioning via CDK/Terraform/CloudFormation), or **File-based** (simple JSON, no dependencies). Deployment verification (9 checks: connection, schema, node/edge counts, orphan/duplicate edge detection, hub analysis, circular dependency detection, impact analysis) ensures graph DB health after setup. The standalone `/aidlc-graph` utility supports 9 modes: build, update, visualize, export (PNG via networkx+matplotlib), impact analysis, search (GraphRAG), repair (CGIG), verify, and teardown. When using the full workflow, the graph is automatically maintained: Reverse Engineering builds the initial graph (brownfield), Code Generation updates it incrementally per unit with integrity verification, and Build & Test uses impact analysis for prioritized test execution (direct dependencies first, then 1-hop, then full suite) with an E2E verification checklist. The orchestrator manages graph DB lifecycle (initialization, health checks, parallel coordination, teardown). Graph operations are non-blocking -- failures log warnings and continue the workflow. All graph node IDs follow a strict normalization convention for consistency across units and queries: `u-{NN}` for units (lowercase, zero-padded), `mod-{kebab-name}` for modules, `file-{kebab-name}` for files, `comm-{kebab-name}` for communities, and `summary-{parent-id}` for summaries. IDs are always lowercase, hyphen-separated, and type-prefixed. IMPORTS edges follow standardization rules: one edge per import statement, internal files only, resolve to file IDs, deduplicate with MERGE. PNG export generates three visualization types: full dependency graph, community architecture, and impact analysis view. Neptune openCypher does not support `=~` regex -- use STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH, or CONTAINS for string pattern matching. Neptune connectivity via SSM port forwarding may fail with WebSocket timeout -- use SSM Run Command as fallback. Neptune bastion SG requires self-referencing ingress on port 443 for SSM VPC Endpoint communication. Graph-enabled projects include graph infrastructure items in the Operations deployment checklist and developer README. E2E verified with Neo4j backend (15-module TypeScript project: 15 nodes, 41 edges, all checks passed) and Neptune backend (10-unit monorepo: 185 nodes, 403 edges, GraphRAG semantic search verified). Neptune CloudFormation teardown may be blocked by orphaned VPC Endpoint ENIs and GuardDuty-managed security groups -- delete these manually before retrying stack deletion.

**GraphRAG** -- Optional summary-based semantic code retrieval built on the dependency graph. Opt-in during Workflow Planning with `graphRAGEnabled: true`. Claude generates module summaries (purpose, keywords, architectural layer) stored as graph node properties -- no external embedding models or vector databases required. Hybrid community detection groups modules by directory structure plus cross-directory semantic analysis. The `/aidlc-graph search` mode enables semantic code retrieval: Neo4j uses full-text indexes, File backend uses keyword matching, all with graph-context expansion (neighboring modules). Integrated with the workflow pipeline: RE generates initial summaries and communities, Code Gen re-summarizes changed modules, Build & Test uses summaries for semantic test context.

**CGIG (Compilation-Guided Iterative Graph-retrieval)** -- Optional compilation error repair using dependency graph context. During Workflow Planning (Tier 2.25), select from 4 graph construction methods that control what the dependency graph captures:

- **Static** (default) -- File-level dependencies: exports, imports, LOC. Standard dependency graph for impact analysis and visualization.
- **CGIG** -- Class-level enriched: constructors, methods, fields, and type hierarchy on every module node. Enables per-error-type graph queries for targeted compilation repair.
- **Lightweight** -- Import-only: one node per file, IMPORTS edges only. 3-5x faster graph construction for large codebases (500+ files), but insufficient for CGIG repair.
- **Hybrid** -- Static base graph with CGIG reactive expansion. Enriches specific modules with class-level properties only when compilation errors occur, balancing speed and repair capability.

When CGIG or Hybrid is selected, Build & Test runs a compile-parse-graph-query-fix loop (configurable rounds and confidence threshold). Compilation errors are classified into 10 language-agnostic categories (cannot_find_symbol, incompatible_types, missing_method, constructor_mismatch, missing_import, access_violation, missing_override, duplicate_identifier, circular_dependency, generic_type_error), each with a specialized graph query strategy. Suggestions are confidence-scored (0.2--0.9) and filtered by the configurable threshold (default 0.6). All CGIG operations are non-blocking -- failures log warnings and continue the workflow.

**Adaptive depth** means all defined artifacts for a stage are created, but the detail level adapts to problem complexity. A simple bug fix gets concise artifacts; a complex system gets comprehensive treatment.

**ASCII diagrams** use only `+`, `-`, `|`, `^`, `v`, `<`, `>` characters. No Unicode box-drawing characters.

## Artifacts

All documentation is generated in the `aidlc-docs/` directory. Application code is always placed in the workspace root.

## Origin

AI-DLC was originally developed as an AI-driven software development methodology by AWS. This plugin adapts the methodology for Claude Code's native command/agent system:

- Kiro's rule-loading mechanism becomes self-contained agent markdown files
- Kiro's file-based approvals become interactive approval gates
- Single-AI execution becomes multi-agent delegation with model tiering (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
